The current banking system regularly causes problems for customers, including lengthy wait times, a lack of service options, and sluggish procedures. While there are many mobile applications available for online services, there are none for offline services. This project presents a mobile application that offers real-time information on service availabilities and wait times for offline services. By utilizing this application, we intend to lessen customer dissatisfaction, effectively allocate resources, and enhance the total banking experience for our customers. Real-time service data will be gathered through secure interaction with bank systems. The project leverages advanced technologies like Flutter, Node.js, Firebase, and Cloud Store. This application is unique and innovative as the whole idea lies in providing real-time service availability & slot booking for offline banking services. This unique piece of work signifies a plausible remedy for the shortcomings in banking today, as an unconventional approach to resource management and operational efficiency within that industry. The ability for this to be applied on mass and further research done in the field of enhancing offline banking services is sizeable.
